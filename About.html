    This project is a collaboration between the Nursing Department at York College of Pennsylvania and the YCP computer
    science department under the supervision of Rachael Schmitz.
    This website was created as a semester long project for the CS320 - Computer Science Software Engineering course by
    Team Pheonix, a group of three YCP students.  These students being Nathan Dow, Ryon Washington, and Andrew Watkins.
    <br></br>
    The York College of PA students working on the project about postpartum depression
    are demonstrating their commitment to making a positive impact on their community
    and showing their dedication to creating meaningful change.
    <br></br>
    This project aims to serve as a tool for new parents to keep track of their mental health following the birth of their
    children. Postpartum Depression is something that not many people know about but has an immense impact on new  parents
    every day and can make small tasks such as taking care of themselves or their newborns increasingly difficult.
    This project aims to provide resources for these new parents so that they can take better care of themselves.
